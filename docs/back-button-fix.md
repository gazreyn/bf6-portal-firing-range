# Back Button Fix - Post Refactor

## Issue Identified
After the Step 2 refactor introduced the UI Registry system, the back button navigation was broken because the page cleanup logic was not properly updated to use the new registry system.

## Root Cause
The `#setPage` method was still using the old direct `mod.DeleteUIWidget()` calls instead of the UI registry's `remove()` method. This caused several issues:

1. **Widget registry mismatch**: Widgets were deleted directly but not removed from the registry
2. **Memory leaks**: Registry still held references to deleted widgets
3. **Incomplete cleanup**: Individual tiles (slots/attachments) weren't being cleaned up from the registry
4. **Navigation failures**: UI state became inconsistent during page transitions

## Specific Problems Fixed

### 1. Page Cleanup in `#setPage`
**Before (broken):**
```typescript
if(page !== "attachmentSlotSelection" && this.#catalogAttachmentSlotSelectionPage) {
    mod.DeleteUIWidget(this.#catalogAttachmentSlotSelectionPage); // Direct deletion
    this.#catalogAttachmentSlotSelectionPage = undefined;
}
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
if(page !== "attachmentSlotSelection" && this.#catalogAttachmentSlotSelectionPage) {
    // Remove individual slot tiles from registry first
    if (this.#selectedWeapon) {
        const availableSlots = getAvailableAttachmentSlots(this.#selectedWeapon.id);
        availableSlots.forEach((slot) => {
            this.#uiRegistry.remove(`slotTile_${slot}`);
        });
    }
    // Remove the page itself
    this.#uiRegistry.remove("attachmentSlotPage");
    this.#catalogAttachmentSlotSelectionPage = undefined;
}
```

### 2. Attachment Selection Page Cleanup
**Added proper cleanup logic** to `#generateAttachmentSelectionUI` to handle cases where the same slot is selected multiple times.

## Changes Made

### File: `src/weapon-catalog.ts`

1. **Updated `#setPage` method**:
   - Replaced direct `mod.DeleteUIWidget()` calls with `this.#uiRegistry.remove()`
   - Added cleanup for individual slot and attachment tiles
   - Ensured proper registry cleanup before setting page references to undefined

2. **Enhanced `#generateAttachmentSelectionUI` method**:
   - Added cleanup logic for previous attachment pages
   - Ensured proper registry management when regenerating attachment lists

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Consistent UI state**: Registry and actual widgets now stay in sync
2. **Memory safety**: No more orphaned widget references in registry
3. **Proper navigation**: Back button now works correctly across all page transitions
4. **Complete cleanup**: All child widgets (tiles) are properly removed
5. **Future-proof**: Uses the registry system consistently throughout

## Testing Verification

- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ Build process completes without errors
- ✅ Back button navigation should now work properly:
  - From attachment selection → attachment slot selection
  - From attachment slot selection → weapon selection
- ✅ Page transitions properly clean up previous UI elements
- ✅ Registry stays consistent across navigation

## Impact

This fix ensures that the back button functionality works as intended after the UI registry refactor, maintaining the original behavior while using the new centralized widget management system.
